This repository is used to test several stuffs I have concerned about Git

- commit's hash is calculated with an implicit header, not its content only
- how can Git quickly perform "git log" or "git blame" in case having many commits?
- why can't packfile work without pack index?
- when does an octopus merge happen?
- "git gc" removes orphan commits (commits that are not reachable from any branch)

I'm trolling. Why do you care?
